# Creating a Basic Webpage
This is a simple webpage that demonstrates the use of the **doctype declaration** and **document tree**, as well as _how to use different HTML tags_ and how they display to the user.
I created an _index.html_ file that can be opened in the Chrome web browser to view the contents of the page, which includes an _h1_ header tag and _p_ paragraph tag.
